## Architecture

The RSSN Project utilizes a **'1+N' architecture**, featuring **rssn** as the core foundation supported by numerous official and community-developed plugins and expansions.

Current official ecosystem projects include:

* **The Janus Project** (In Development, Physics Simulation)
* **rssn-advanced** (In Development, Symbolic Computing)

These peripheral projects are designed to seamlessly extend the capabilities of the core RSSN framework.
