  This is the Rust Scientific, Symbolic and Numerical
  Computing Library (RSSN) Project source code archive. In
  this project, we explore the possibilities of using modern
  technology (like LLVM) and programming language (like
  Rust) to build computing tools for our research. Our main
  develop focus of the project are symbolic computing
  functionalities, along side modules for physics simulation
  functionalities and numerical functionalities. A
  significant portion of our research investigates how
  modern compiler technologies could have an impact on
  modernizing programming language and in the mean time
  maintain high performance. Special attention is also given
  to the pros and cons of LLM assistant coding and testing
  the boundary for its application. The project is still
  under active development and research findings are subject
  to updates. Community feedback and contributions are
  highly welcome.
